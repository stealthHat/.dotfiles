# Dotfiles

A simple repo to save my .files with a [autorice](https://github.com/stealthHat/.dotfiles/blob/master/install/autorice-deploy) script

### autorice will do:
  * setup the best mirrors for my contry (brazil)
  * configure pacman to look pretty 
  * makes symbolyc links of my dotfiles to $HOME (within their respective folders)
  * install yay
  * install all the apps on progs.cvs (including my builds of suckless tools)
  * install oh-my-zsh 
  * setup vim plug 
  * setup tmux plug 

disclaimer: 
   only tested on Arch linux (fresh install is recommended)
   this repository needs to be in $HOME/git for the autorice script works
