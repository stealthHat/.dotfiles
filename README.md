# Dotfiles

A simple repo to save my .files with a [autorice](https://github.com/stealthHat/.dotfiles/blob/master/install/autorice-deploy) script

### autorice will do:
  * Setup the best mirrors for my country (Brazil)
  * Configure pacman to look pretty
  * Makes symbolic links of my dotfiles to $HOME (within their respective folders)
  * Install yay
  * Install all the packages and repositories on [progs.cvs](https://github.com/stealthHat/.dotfiles/blob/master/install/progs.csv) (Including my forks of [suckless ](https://suckless.org/) [DWM](https://github.com/stealthHat/dwm),[Slstatus](https://github.com/stealthHat/slstatus) and [St](https://github.com/stealthHat/st) )
  * Setup tmux

disclaimer:
   only tested on Arch linux (fresh install is recommended)
   this repository needs to be in $HOME/git for the autorice script works
